# FaceMask WebCam Detection

This was created as part of the module Sensors networks in Universit√© de Technologie de Troyes (UTT) in autumn 2020. It has been created by Thomas Simon, Pierre Sinnave and myself.  
The goal was to create a model allowing through deeplearning to recognize the wearing of a mask by the persons in front of the camera. 

## Requirements

* Install Python 3 apt-get install python3
* Install the required python libs `pip install matplotlib numpy opencv_python scikit_learn tensorflow`

## How to use
1. Create the trained model to recognize the mask on a picture `python3 createmaskedmodel.py`
2. Execute the script to access the webcam and evaluate the webcam flow `python3 maskedcam.py`
